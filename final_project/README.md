# Final Project

**tl;dr** Do something cool, vaguely related to this course.

Details:

1. You can work in teams.
    No restriction on size, you just need my approval.

1. Your final submission will be:
    1. github repo
        1. Contains all artifacts related to your project
        1. Has a professional README describing your project
    1. presentation
        1. possibly to the whole class in the final exam timeslot
        1. possibly to me 1-1
    1. social media posts about your project (e.g. in <https://news.ycombinator.com>, <https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLama>) 

1. Example ideas:
    1. Implement a RAG system for some topic of interest to you
    1. Implement a paper
    1. Write a tutorial for a library (e.g. LMQL)
    1. Write your own library (e.g. to implement RAG)
    1. I encourage you to combine this project with thesis / research / other class projects / internship work / anything else.

1. You must have an "experimental component"
    1. RAG: evaluating your system's effectiveness on appropriate data
    1. Paper: does the accuracy / runtime meet your expectations?
    1. Libraries: what is the accuracy / runtime of different options?

1. Submit ideas by October 14th.  (I'll create a github issue.)

    You'll need:
    1. Project title
    1. List of participants
    1. 2-5 sentence description of what you'll do
    1. List any references / links you'll use

1. Expectations
    1. Time investment: at least 3hr/week * 10 weeks = at least 30 hours
    1. Think of this as something to show off to future employers, not as something to get a grade.
